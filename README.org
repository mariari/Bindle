* bindle
A first-class module system for Common Lisp with module signatures and
module functors.

** A taste of bindle
Here's an applicative written using bindle =defmodule=.
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (eval-when (:compile-toplevel :load-toplevel :execute)
    (defmodule *basic* sig
      (fun return ts)
      (fun app f-app app)
      (val map)))

  (defmodule make ((mod *basic*)) *app*
    (defun return (ts)
      (mod.return ts))

    (defun app (f-app app)
      (mod.app f-app app))

    (defun derived-map (f ts)
      (app (return f) ts))

    (defun map (f xs)
      (if (eq :custom (car mod.map))
          (funcall (cadr mod.map) f xs)
          (derived-map f xs)))

    (defun mapn (f arg1 &rest args)
      (reduce (lambda (acc x) (app acc x)) args :initial-value (map f arg1))))

** Currently Not Supported
- Nested modules
  + This can be simulated rather easily, check out the wiki article on
    it here.
- Macros
  + Due to how expanders work, macros are a bit annoying to deal with,
    the wiki gives a somewhat error prone implementation here.
    * This implementation adds a small overhead to a macro and only
      works fully on expansions which do not export anything
  + To properly include macro code into your project checkout the wiki
    page here (TODO: make wiki page explaining to make an expander)
